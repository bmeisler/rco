      <h2>History of

        <p>The Russian Chamber Orchestra was founded in 1992 by its 
Music Director and Conductor, Alexander Vereshagin. Mr. Vereshagin was educated 
in the Glinka Capella and continued his studies at the Leningrad National 
Conservatory before joinging their prestigious faculty in 1972. He brings to the 
United States a vast conducting experience from the Music Theater of St. 
Petersburg Conservatory, the Philharmonic of St. Petersburg, the St. Petersburg 
Capella, the Chamber Orchestra "Mozarteum," the Chamber Orchestra of the Kirov 
Opera and as founding conductor of the Smolniy Cathedral Concert 
Series.</p>

      <p>The professional experience of the 
members of the Russian Chamber Orchestra includes performing with such 
world-renowned orchestras as the USSR State Symphony, Moscow Philharmonic State 
Symphony, Kiev Virtuoso Symphony, Georgian State Chamber Orchestra, Stockholm 
Philharmonic Orchestra, Sweden, Teatro del Opera, Rome, Italy, and the Symphony 
Orchestra of Gran Canaria, Spain. For many, their studies started in childhood, 
continued through graduation from the great conservatories in St. Petersburg, 
Moscow and other major cities, then on to successful careers performing, 
recording and touring throughout Europe, Japan, and North and South America. 
Alexander Vereshagin's musical talent and strong leadership have enabled him to 
bring together these uniquely gifted musicians to create an orchestra which has 
been enthusiastically received by audiences and critics alike. They have 
performed at the Russian Center, the Robert Mondavi Festival, various concert 
series in San Francisco, San Jose and Carmel, the Bach Society First 
International Classical Music Fest, the International Music Festival in Yachats, 
Oregon, and a concert tour in Florida. Current plans are to continue a series of 
recitals in Marin County, featuring soloists and small ensembles as well as the 
full orchestra.</font></p>

      <p>In addition to traditional 
repertoire, the Russian Chamber Orchestra offers masterpieces of Russian 
composers, such as the <i>Serenade for Strings </i>by Tchaikovsky, the 
<i>Variation on a Theme of Tchaikovsky </i>by Arensky, <i>Symphonietta </i>by 
Rimsky-Korsakov, <i>Chamber Symphony </i>and <i>Piano Concerto </i>by 
Shostokovich, <i>Russian Folk Songs </i>by Ljadov, and brilliant miniatures by 
Borodin, Glinka, Rachmaninoff and Glazunov. The ability of these musicians to 
perform equally well as soloists, or in small ensembles, or in a full 12-piece 
string orchestra, and also to work with other vocal and instrumental soloists 
and choirs, enables them to provide their audiences with an exceptional variety 
of programs.</font></p>

      <p>Beginning in February, 1999, with the 
premier of Mr. Vereshagin' s <i>Prince Igor Suite, </i>the Russian Chamber 
Orchestra featured some entirely new Vereshagin arrangements of works by 
Shostakovich, Rimsky-Korsakov and others, as well as pieces little known in the 
West. Much of the orchestra's future performances will therefore consist of 
music never or rarely heard before, along with familiar favorites.</p>
